# object  -python is object oriented programming language almost everything in python is object  with properties nd method :
#CLASSES- Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object,
# allowing new instances of that type to be made.
# Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.
# Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.



# OOPS - USED DRY CONCEPT WHICH MEANS DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF
# WE CAN USE CLASS FOR RESTRICTION ALSO WHICH DONT ALLOW OTHERE TO ACCESS
